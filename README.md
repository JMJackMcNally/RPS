# RPS
A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built as a multi-client server program.

This project was made for Dr. Lisa Frye's Network and Secure Programming course at Kutztown University, in Fall of 2021.

File Manifest:
    client.py - runs the client side program
    server.py - runs the server side program
    library.py - houses useful functions for both server.py and client.py
    README.md - houses implementation and design information
	
	No makefile since the entire project is in Python, which does not need to be compiled.
